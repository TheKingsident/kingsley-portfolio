## Challenges Faced

1. **Mobile Responsiveness**  
  Ensuring the website is fully responsive and mobile-friendly required multiple iterations of the layout, especially for the sidebar and navigation.  

2. **Home Layout**  
  The floating animations and overlapping elements on the home layout were challenging to implement, requiring precise positioning and animation timing.  

3. **Custom Cursor**  
  Implementing the custom cursor involved tracking mouse movements and dynamically updating the cursor's position and style.  

4. **Sidebar Functionality**  
  Making the sidebar intuitive and functional on both desktop and mobile devices required smooth transitions, proper state management, and accessibility.  

5. **Contact Form Validation**  
  Integrating Google reCAPTCHA and handling form validation securely required careful handling of user input and server-side validation.
